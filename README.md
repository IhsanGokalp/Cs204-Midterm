# Cs204-Midterm
When there is no customer in DB, it gives the empty list end a "true" boolean value to parameter with the name noCutomers.

I could not try adding new customer through postman. So I made a formLogin you can give "user" for username and "password" to
password to authanticate through web browser.
To try it in postman, line 23, 24 and 25 needed to be removed from WebSecurityConfig.java.
